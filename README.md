# Stock-Market-Clustering-Using-Kmeans
Utilized Python's scikit-learn library to implement the K-means for grouping stocks based on their price movements.

Stock market clustering using k-means is a useful technique for understanding the stock market and
identifying patterns in stock price movements. The project successfully clustered stocks into groups based on
their daily price movements using the k-means algorithm. The results of the project can be used by investors
to make informed decisions when investing in the stock market.
